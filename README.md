# Case Study Writing

### What is a Technical Case Study?
**Case Studies** are the holy grail of technical writing. It is a synthesis of documentation, technical blogging, and storytelling. At the Marcy Lab School, your technical case study will break down and outline--*in great detail*--the entire process of creating your project-- from the conception of the idea, to planning and implementation, and beyond! 

### Why Write a Case Study?
Typically, when a developer wants to share their coding project on the web, they host their code base on Github. If they deployed their project to a production environment, they have a website or some public-facing version of their application. Those artifacts only tell part of the story! You worked hard on your project! And now, you will have the opportunity to share every step of the process in your technical case study. 

A technical case study is a fantastic way to brand yourself on the web-- to companies, recruiters, hiring managers, and the general developer community. It documents your ability to solve problems, both technical and non-technical. In addition to showcasing your coding and implementation abilities, a case study showcases your technical writing abilities. Being able to code is important, but the ability to communicate your entire project journey makes it even better! 

Finally, having a well-written, high-quality case study will elevate any project! It makes a project *feel* so much more polished because you, the developer(s), poured your time and effort into this beautiful piece of writing that both technical and non-technical personnel can appreciate and feel a part of. 

## Requirements

At the Marcy Lab School, we require that your technical case study be **1,500 to 2,000 words**. It might sound like a lot, but that's the same amount of content as a few of your Marcy Lab blogs. 

Furthermore, you can refer back to your previous project submissions as you can reuse some of that material. This includes, but is not limited to, your project proposal, your wireframes, ERD diagrams, and any other planning materials you've written. 

Like your Marcy Lab blogs, your writing should be supplemented with screenshots of your project, code snippets, diagrams, stock images,  technology logos, etc.

Finally, you can publish your case study on a professional blogging website, such as [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Dev Community](https://dev.to/). If you would like to go above and beyond, you can publish your case study on a custom website that you deploy. The following are examples of professional case studies hosted on their own website:
- [Venice](https://venice-framework.github.io/case-study.html)
- [SpaceCraft](https://spacecraft-repl.com/whitepaper)
- [Mothership](https://mothership.live/case-study.html)

## Potential Sections

**_So what information should you include in your technical case study?_** Every capstone project is unique. The sections in your case study writing may be different from another group's depending on the features or technologies you want to highlight. However, you should use the following format as guidelines. 

### Application Overview

- [The What]

### How did the idea come about? 
    
- [The Why]
    
### Application Design Overview

- [The How]
- [Technology stack overview and why they chose the technologies they chose?]
- [Backend/Database, possible schema diagrams]
- [UI, possible screenshots of the product]
- [Will likely be the biggest section of the technical case study]
        
### Challenges 
- [Need to also discuss *Implemented Solutions*. We want to talk about technical challenges that we *overcame* and found a thoughtful and good solution to.]
- [Do not mention challenges the involved taking the easy way out]
- [Individual Ownership: Your technical case study should have *at least* one technical challenge per member of your group, possibly more.]
        
### Extension Opportunities

- [This section is the "If I had more time..." section.]

### Closing 

Discussing extension opportunities is a fine way to conclude your technical case study. However, you might choose to write a separate closing section or paragraph. 

### References and Links

**Don't forget to include references and links to other important resources pertaining to your project!** Somewhere in your technical case study (at the end is a good choice), you **MUST** include:

- Link(s) your public Github repositories
- Link to your deploy application
- Link(s) to your Linkedin profiles or other professional social media

**Additionally, you should link your published technical case study in the READMEs of your Github repositories.**
