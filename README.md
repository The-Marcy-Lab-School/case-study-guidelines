# Case Study Writing

### What is a Technical Case Study?
**Case Studies** are the holy grail of technical writing. It is a synthesis of documentation, technical blogging, and storytelling. At the Marcy Lab School, your technical case study will break down and outline in great detail the entire process of creating your project-- from the conception of the idea, to planning and implementation, and beyond! 

### Why Write a Case Study?
Typically, when a developer wants to share their coding project on the web, they host their code base on Github. If they deployed their project to a production environment, they have a website or some public-facing version of their application. Those artifacts only tell part of the story. You worked hard on your project! Everyone should know, and you will have the opportunity to share every step of the process in your technical case study. 

Having a well-written, high-quality technical case study will elevate any project! It documents your ability to solve problems, both technical and non-technical. In addition to showcasing your coding and implementation abilities, a technical case study showcases your technical writing abilities as well.

Finally, Having a well-written, high-quality technical case study will elevate any project! It makes a project *feel* so much more polished because the developer(s) put in the time and effort . 


## Requirements

At the Marcy Lab School, we require that your Case Study Writing be **1,500 to 2,000 words**. It might sound like a lot, but that's the same amount of content as a few of your Marcy Lab blogs. Furthermore, you should refer back to all your previous project 

Like your Marcy Lab blogs, your writing should be supplemented with screenshots of your UI, code snippets, diagram, stock images, and logos. 

You can publish your case study on a 

## Potential Sections

The following are guidelines, but your sections might be different depending on your project. 

### Application Overview

[The What]

### How did the idea come about? 
    
[The Why]
    
### Application Design Overview

[The How]

- Technology stack overview and why they chose the technologies they chose?
- Backend/Database, possible schema diagrams
- UI, possible screenshots of the product
- Will likely be the biggest section of the technical case study 
        
### Challenges 
- Need to also discuss *Implemented Solutions*. We want to talk about technical challenges that we *overcame* and found a thoughtful and good solution to. 
- Do not mention challenges the involved taking the easy way out
- Individual Ownership: Your technical case study should have *at least* one technical challenge per member of your group, possibly more. 
        
### Extension Opportunities

- This section is the "If I had more time..." section.

### Closing and References

Discussing extension opportunities 

- You should link your public Github repositories.
- You should link to your deploy application.
- You should link to your Linkedin profiles.
- Link your published case study in the READMEs of your Github repositories.
