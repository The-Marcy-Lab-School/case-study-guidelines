# Case Study Writing

### What is a Technical Case Study?
**Case Studies** are the holy grail of technical writing. It is a synthesis of documentation, technical blogging, and story telling. At the Marcy Lab School, your technical case study will break down and outline in great detail the entire process of creating your project-- from the conception of the idea, to planning and implemention, and beyond! 

### Why Write a Case Study?
Typically, when a developer wants to share their coding project on the web, they host their code base on Github. If they deployed their project to a production environment, they have a website or some public facing version of their application. Those artifacts only tell part of the story. Everyone should know just how hard you worked hard on your project, and you will have the oportunity to share every step of the process in you technical case study. 

Having a well-written, high-quality technical case study will elevate any project! It showcases your ability to solve technical and non-technical problems. It  and technical writing abilities (in addition to your coding and implementation abiilities). Finally, it makes a project *feel* so much more polished.
- share your aptitude and technical communication with potention employers, including non-technical persons.


## Requirements

At the Marcy Lab School, we require that your Case Study Writing be 1,500 to 2,000 words. It might sound like a lot, but that's the same amount of content as a few of your Marcy Lab blogs. Futhermore, you should refer back to all your previous project 

Like your Marcy Lab blogs, your writing should be supplemented with screenshots of your UI, code snippets, diagram, stock images, and logos. 

You can publish your case study on a
